# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. So far, I've setup an express proeject with a database, configured some routes and controllers and handled errors. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Tech Used
